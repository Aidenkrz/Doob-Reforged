3. **License Headers**  
   - Contributors may include their name in the license header of each file they submit.  
   - If a contributor **includes their authorship**, they retain full control over licensing, and Goob Station is **not** automatically granted rights to relicense the contribution.

   By signing this CLA, you represent and warrant that your contributions do not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party and do not include any code or assets under licenses incompatible with MPL-R.
